# project1-group2

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis of used car sales in the US between the years 2018 and 2020. As a group, our objective was to find answers to the following three questions:
1. What specifications of a vehicle appear to have the largest impact on price?
2. What is the most commonly seen price point for certain vehicles?
3. How does the value of vehicle change over time? And are there any statistically significant differences between the trends of different makes and models?

The results of our analysis is covered in the Word document entitled "Written_Analysis".

The code used to reach the conclusions discussed in the analysis comes in the form of 4 Jupyter Notebooks located in the root folder of this repository.

The data sources used can be found in the form of a few CSV Files in the Resources folder of this repository.

And, finally, the images and graphs used in the presentation for this project can be found in the Powerpoint file located in the root folder of this repository or in the "Images" and "Graphs-Analysis" folders of this repository.
