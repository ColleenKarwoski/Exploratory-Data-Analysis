# project1-group2

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis of used car sales in the US between the years 2018 and 2020. As a group, our objective was to find answers to the following three questions:

1. What specifications of a vehicle appear to have the largest impact on price?
2. What is the most commonly seen price point for certain vehicles?
3. How does the value of vehicle change over time? And is there any statistically significant differences between the trends of different makes and models?

To find the answers to these questions, we used data from a US used car sales CSV file found on Kaggle (the original CSV as well as a CSV containing the cleaned version of the data set can be found within the Resources folder of this repository entitled "used_car_sales.csv" and "cleaned_used_car_data.csv" respectively).

The results of our exploratory data analysis showed that after controlling for the make and model of the vehicle, age and mileage explained a respectable amount of the variation in the prices of different vehicles. One model that showed a particularly strong correlation was ???. In that case roughly ???% of the price variance could be explained by mileage and ???% by age.

The most common price point for vehicles varied wildly across different makes and models. Some of the most budget friendly options included ???, ???, and ???, while ??? held some of the most expensive used vehicles on average.

Based on this exploratory data analysis we were unable to find any consistently explanable differences between the price trends of different makes and models over time. With the exception of some cars that are considered collectors items/vintage, most vehicles saw their value dwindle over time at a fairly similar rate.
